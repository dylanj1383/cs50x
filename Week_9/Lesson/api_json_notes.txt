API = application programming interface
-> set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
-> typically APIs just send u the info u need
-> we can use JSONS to send just the javascript objects (the data)
-> js objects are basically dicts (key-value pairs)

AJAX = asynchronous javascript and xml
 -> refresh sections of page w/o refreshing whole page 
 -> e.g. just update the score of a sports game on a website
