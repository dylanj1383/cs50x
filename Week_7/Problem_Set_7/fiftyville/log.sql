-- 161|Ruth|2024|7|28|Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot 
-- and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the 
-- parking lot in that time frame. [X1]

-- 162|Eugene|2024|7|28|I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I 
-- arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- [X2]

-- 163|Raymond|2024|7|28|As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. 
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The 
-- thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. [X3]
