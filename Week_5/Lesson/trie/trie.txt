trie = short for retrieval

Each new letter of a name will be an array of 26 chars. 

There is a pointer that pionts to the next letter. in the word. 

Once you reach the end of a word, you can indicate that with memory (e.g. if the node's number is not null)

if u want to continue on (e.g. TOAD vs TOADETTE), you can just add more pointers to more arrays

With this structure, lookup is independant of how many names we already have. 
It is only O(k), where k is the length of the name. K is presumably finite, so it is O(1) insertion/lookup/etc.

See screenshot for visualization. 

We can use trie to impelement a dictionary as well.
