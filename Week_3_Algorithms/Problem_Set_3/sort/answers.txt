sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Qickest with small datasets but slows down and matches Sort3 as the data gets bigger, just like Bubble Sort does;O(n^2)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Itâ€™s always the fastest overall, with the lowest run time. That lines up with Merge Sort O(nlogn)

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Slows dramatically as data gets larger(O(n^2) behaviour), but still loses to sort1 on small data
