not like arrays which are implemented on a low level; you can implement these in many ways but the
funcitonality/usage is what defines them

QUEUS:
- first in first out (FIFO)
- like a lineup of ppl waiting for something

- operations:
    - enque (add someone to the line; add to the end of the queue)
    - deque (remove someone from the line; remove from the front of the queue)




STACKS:
- last in first out (LIFO)
- literally like a stack of items

- operations:
    - push (add to the stop of the stack)
    - pop (remove from the top of the stack)
